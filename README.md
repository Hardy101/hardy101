# 👋 Hey there, I’m Eghosa

I'm a **self-taught web developer** and a **Microbiology undergrad** who loves turning caffeine and code into cool things.

## 💻 What I Do

- Build web apps that don’t just work—they _vibe_
- Write a little, dream a lot
- Work on projects that mix **tech, storytelling, and philosophy**

## 🧠 Currently Cooking

- ✍️ Planning a 100-day writing challenge on [LinkedIn](#) and [Twitter](#) _(when life chills out a bit)_
- 📚 Plotting a dystopian novel where **every birth means someone has to die**—literally
